    <p>This is absolutely the best homemade apple pie you'll ever make! It has a flaky, buttery crust and a tender, lightly-spiced apple pie filling.</p> 
    <p>Use a combination of apples for best flavor, and bake until the top is golden and the filling is bubbly!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds good cooking apples</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup to 2/3 cup sugar, depending on how sweet you like your pie</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brandy, optional </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 double crust sour cream pie dough</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Peel, core and slice or roughly chop the apples into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices or chunks. As you cut your apple slices, add them to a large bowl and sprinkle them with the lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to help keep them 
            from turning brown.</p></li>
        <li><p>Combine the sugar, flour and spices (allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon) in a bowl. Add the flour mixture to the apple slices and use your hands to distribute the flour through the apples so they are well coated. Sprinkle with vanilla 
            extract and 
            brandy (if using) and stir to coat all the apples.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375째F. Place one oven rack in the lowest position and put a large rimmed baking sheet on it to catch any drippings from the pie. Position a second rack the next rung up (still in the lower third of the oven).</p></li>
        <li><p>Roll out the dough and line the pie plate:Remove one disk of pie dough from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. Place disk on a lightly floured, clean, flat surface. Using a rolling pin, roll out 
            the pie dough to a 12-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. As you roll out the dough, check to make sure it isn't sticking. If and when it starts to stick, gently lift it up and sprinkle a little more flour on the table surface 
            or on the pie dough to keep the dough from sticking. Gently place the rolled out dough onto a 9-inch pie plate. Press down to line the pie dish with the dough.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the apple filling: Arrange the apple slices in the dough-lined pie plate. Mound the apples in the center.</p></li>
        <li><p>Roll out the top crust, place over apples, trim and crimp edges: Roll out the second disk of dough, again to 12-inches. Gently place the second round of pie dough over the apples. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, 
            leaving a 3/4 inch overhang from the edges of the pie pan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Brush with the egg wash and cut vents:
            Place egg yolk and cream in a small bowl and use a fork to stir until well combined. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the top and fluted edges of the pie. Use a sharp knife to cut slits in the top of the pie 
            crust for steam vents.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake: Place pie on oven rack centered over the baking sheet on the rack below it to catch any drippings. Bake the pie at 375째F until crust begins to lightly brown, about 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350째F.
            Bake until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling all over, an additional hour or up to another hour and a half, depending on the type of apples you are using. If you have an instant-read thermometer, 
            it should read 200째F when inserted in the center of the pie.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cool: Transfer the apple pie to a rack to cool for at least 1 hour. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. Great with a side of vanilla ice cream.</p></li>
