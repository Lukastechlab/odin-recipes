    <p>Today, it’s all about our broccoli cheese pasta bake. This pasta bake is a casserole that combines two flavors most people enjoy, broccoli and cheese. It’s very similar to John’s cheesy pasta bake casserole that we shared back in 2019.</p>

    <p>This recipe starts with a short pasta noodle and fresh broccoli florets tossed in a creamy cheese sauce topped with freshly shredded cheese. It doesn’t get much better than that!</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked penne pasta (or other short pasta noodle)</li>
        <li>4 cups fresh broccoli florets</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic, minced or pressed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
